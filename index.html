			<h3>One difficult street crossing in the Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon. </h3>
			<p>
				Holladay Park Plaza is a continuing care retirement community. NE 16th Avenue and parking lots separate
				Holladay Park Plaza residents from direct access to Lloyd Center.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lloyd Center has- covered walking areas, an indoor ice rink, a food court, a restuarant, movie theaters, department stores, including
				Sears, Macy's and Nordstroms.
			</p>

			<p>
				The shortest route from Holladay Park Plaza's main entrance is west, across NE 16th Ave, through a parking lot, and into Sears.   To take this route is to jaywalk and to scramble the few feet
				up and over a planted median strip.
				The route is popular and the legal alternatives seem inconvenient.
